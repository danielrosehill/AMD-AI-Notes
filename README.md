# AMD AI Notes

A small notebook intended for those who own AMD GPUs and are trying to get things working (like local LLMs, Comfy UI, and more) while minimising the amount of hair removed from their scalp.

## Reference System

The notes in this repository were validated on the following system:

| Component | Specification |
|-----------|---------------|
| **GPU** | AMD Radeon RX 7700 XT (Navi 32, gfx1101) |
| **CPU** | Intel Core i7-12700F (12th Gen) |
| **RAM** | 64 GB |
| **ROCm** | 6.3.0 |
| **OS** | Ubuntu (Linux) |

If you have similar hardware, the configurations and workarounds described here should work for you. Your mileage may vary with different GPU generations (especially different gfx versions).

The amount of hair that I have extracted from my scalp has been declining for some years. For this I thank:

- Claude and ChatGPT 
- Reddit 

## About Me 

Just a regular guy (ok, somewhat regular) who bought a workstation with an AMD GPU before getting "into" AI and local AI.

As much as trying to work around NVIDIA-centric apps drives me crazy, I've found that with perseverence you can usually find solutions.

If I had a money tree in my garden, I would probably go out and buy an Nvidia GPU tomorrow. However, I also quite like working with AMD. Their more affordable GPUs are not to be sniffed at. Therefore I persevere.
